# Waterfall.js

> Tired of use creepy hacks or heavy ways to get a Grid based on Pinterest?

1KB and Works without any dependency \o/

## The "Why"

Currently the best option today to do this job is Masonry, but it's very heavy and have dependency of jQuery. Please understand: this isn't a problem is most cases, but in cases when perfomance and page weight matters, the best case is try other options: maybe pure CSS? It's possible?

This question have a good point. Yes, exists CSS ways to solve, using flexbox or columns technic, but doesn't work well when you don't know about your data/structure. So we have to use JavaScript. The challenge is create a decent algorithm where no matter the structure: Waterfall will work.

However; Waterfall always will consider items with **same width** :)

## How to Use?

#### Getting

First at all, get Waterfall using [Download Option](https://github.com/raphamorim/waterfall.js/archive/master.zip) or via bower.

To get using [Bower](http://bower.io) just run this command

```sh
bower install waterfall
```

Or get using NPM just run this command

```sh
npm install waterfall.js
```

Add the source before body tag end:

```html
<script src="waterfall.min.js"></script>
</body>
```

#### Usage

Define your grid structure:

```html
<div class="grid">
    <div class="item">Solid Snake</div>
    <div class="item">Riou</div>
    <div class="item">Jack Russel</div>
</div>
```

Call Waterfall function with your grid as a argument and let the magic happens :)

```javascript

waterfall('.grid');
// or
var grid = document.querySelector('.grid');
waterfall(grid);

```
